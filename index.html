       <h2>Hello again!</h2><!-- A simple greeting followed by a introduction of myself -->
        <p>
         My name is David Villa, currently, I'm a student at Thinkful learning the art of  Web Development. I currently live in California but my former job had me traveling all across the U.S. as a truck driver, delivering all sorts of goods. Now I plan on traveling all across the internet as a developer building all sorts of programs.

       <h2>A little about myself.</h2><!-- talked about   some goals and interests in the developer world.-->

       <p>
         Truthfully, I'm new to programming, and I have found it to be confusing and difficult but also exciting and very rewarding! Programming has changed my thought process in the way I view the internet. It's inspiring to see the teams of developers that run our everyday apps and websites to make our lifes a tiny bit easier. To the bold developers working on new technologies such as machine learning and autonomous driving. I love to drive, from sliding into the next gear of a manual transmission to driving slowly past breathtaking views, yet I can appreciate the advantages of self-driving transportation. I hope to become a successful software engineer with the knowledge I'm gaining here at Thinkful.
